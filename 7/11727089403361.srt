1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,183
The quarrel

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,400
Peppa and Suzy Sheep are playing Snap.

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Snap! I win!

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Peppa and Suzy are best friends.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,183
Snap! I win again!

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
You cheat it!

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
I did not!

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,200
You looked at the card!

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,100
I did not!

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,200
I don't want to play with you anymore.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh dear!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,200
Peppa and Suzy have had a quarrel.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,700
Mummy Sheep is here to take Suzy home.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,500
Peppa, say byebye to Suzy.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
I am not talking to her.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,200
And I am not talking to her.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,100
Oh, I am sure they will make it up.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,100
They are always best friends really.

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,600
It is not funny.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,583
We are not best friends anymore.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Daddy pig is making supper.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,700
Peppa, George, supper time.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,683
It. S spaghetti.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
What's the matter, Peppa?

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Peppa and Suzy have had a little quarrel.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,600
But I do miss Suzy a bit.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,100
Let's give Suzy a call.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,600
Hello, Mrs. Pig.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
May Peppa talk with Suzy, please?

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Hello, Suzy!

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Hello, Peppa!

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,600
We can be friends again if you say sorry.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm sorry I said you cheated it,

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,300
even though you did cheat.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,283
Well, I'm sorry you ever are my best friend.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,100
It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,800
I can easily find a new best friend.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,700
It's a lovely sunny day.

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,000
All the children are at the playground.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,983
Danny Dog is on the roundabout
with his best friend Pedro Pony.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,100
George is on the seesaw
with his best friend Richard Rabbit.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,000
Seesaw! Seesaw!

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,700
Suzy Sheep is on the swings,

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,100
on herown.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Peppa is playing mini golf,

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,000
on herown.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Here is Emily elephant.

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Can I have a go?

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Emily, Suzy Sheep is not
my best friend anymore.

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
So you can be my best friend.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,183
But my best friend is Candy Cat.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,500
WEE!

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Zoey, if you want,

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,800
you can be my best friend.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,783
But my best friend is Rebecca Rabbit.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Hello, Suzy!

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,600
Hello, Peppa.

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, good.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I see you two are friends again.

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
We are not friends.

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
We will never be friends again.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,100
I think it's about time
you two make it up.

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,700
Peppa, say sorry to Suzy.

65
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Only she says sorry first.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
I know, I will count to three,

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,600
and you can both say sorry
at the same time.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,900
All right!

69
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
One, two, three.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,900
Sorry.

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,800
Now you can be best friends again.

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,300
Hooray!

73
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Suzy, let's play mini golf.

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
Good idea!

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Peppa and Suzy are best friends again.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,200
Me first!

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,700
My go!

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,200
My ball went into the hole, so I win.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,700
But my ball knocked it in, so I win.

80
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
You are just making the rules up, .

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,200
You are making the rules up.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I win!

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,100
No, I win!

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,700
You two are just the same.

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,683
That's why Suzy is my best friend
in the whole world.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,983
And Peppa is my best friend
in the whole world ever.
