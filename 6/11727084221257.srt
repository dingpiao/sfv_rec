1
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:22,005
The Tooth Fairy!

2
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,319
Peppa and George are having

3
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:31,632
their favorite food --- spaghetti!

4
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,530
What a lot of noise!

5
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:40,993
Finished!

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,931
Ah, now we'll have a bit of quiet!

7
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:51,328
What's that?

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,031
It's a tooth!

9
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,321
Where did that come from?

10
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:58,522
Peppa, maybe you
should look in the mirror!

11
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:02,530
Oh!

12
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,610
It's my tooth! It's fallen out!

13
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,363
Don't worry, Peppa.

14
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:11,683
It's just a milk tooth -

15
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:13,186
They're meant to fall out.

16
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,448
Will I grow a new one, Mummy?

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,380
Yes, you will, Peppa.

18
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:20,712
It also means the Tooth Fairy
will be paying you a visit.

19
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,343
Tooth Fairy?

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,441
Yes, the Tooth Fairy.

21
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,906
If you put the tooth under
your pillow tonight,

22
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,013
the Tooth Fairy will come.

23
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,679
The Tooth Fairy will take the tooth.

24
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,544
And in its place,
she will leave a shiny coin!

25
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:44,721
When I grow up,

26
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,393
I want to be a Tooth Fairy!

27
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:50,936
And what would you like to be
when you grow up, George?

28
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,542
Dine-Saw!

29
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:54,899
A dinosaur!

30
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,790
Quick, George, it's bedtime!

31
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:00,717
We don't want to
miss the Tooth Fairy!

32
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:06,187
Before going to bed,
Peppa and George brush their teeth.

33
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,019
Peppa, what are you doing?

34
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,680
I'm brushing my tooth
so it is nice and clean

35
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,606
for the Tooth Fairy.

36
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,541
Peppa cannot wait to get into bed.

37
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,914
Peppa is putting her tooth
under the pillow

38
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,388
for the Tooth Fairy.

39
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,452
Goodnight, Peppa and George.

40
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:32,074
Goodnight, Mummy!
Goodnight, Daddy!

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,954
Goodnight, my Little piggies!

42
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,602
George, I'm not going to sleep!

43
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,152
Let's both stay awake all night
and see the Tooth Fairy!

44
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:55,674
This Tooth Fairy is very late!

45
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,610
The Tooth Fairy is taking
a long time to arrive.

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,457
Where is that Tooth Fairy?

47
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:08,716
What is that noise?

48
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,068
Is it the Tooth Fairy?

49
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,983
George, can you hear something?

50
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,933
Oh, George!

51
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,472
Oh, the noise is George.

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,288
He was so tired, he has fallen asleep.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,174
George is not very good
at staying awake, but I am.

54
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,648
I am going to stay awake
and see the Tooth Fairy.

55
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,744
I'm not going to sleep...

56
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:42,727
The Tooth Fairy has arrived.

57
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,283
But Peppa is asleep.

58
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:47,855
Hello, Peppa.

59
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:51,337
Would you like this coin
in return for your tooth?

60
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,094
What a nice, clean tooth.

61
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:00,115
Thank you, Peppa, Goodnight.

62
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,847
Peppa, George, wake up.
It's morning.

63
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,945
What? I wasn't asleep!

64
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,583
Did the Tooth Fairy come?

65
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,006
No!

66
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's take a look under your pillow.

67
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:25,336
Look, Peppa! The Tooth Fairy
has been and she's left you a coin!

68
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,485
Hurray!

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,341
You fell asleep, didn't you?

70
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,597
Well, maybe I fell asleep
just for a Little bit...

71
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,870
Next time, I will stay awake,

72
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:40,360
and I will see
the Tooth Fairy!
