All their friends

Peppa is dressed as
a fairy princess.

00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,907
And George is

Rebecca Rabbit and Pedro Pony.

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,223
Suzy is wearing her
nurse's costume.

11
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,193
Hello, Suzy!

12
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:53,466
Hello, Mr. Pig!

13
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:55,410
I'm glad the nurse has arrived!

14
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,220
Have you just come from
the hospital?

15
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:01,747
Er, I'm not a real nurse.
It's just pretend.

16
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:07,692
Very good. My, my!
Who have we here?

17
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,215
Woof! Woof! I'm a pirate!
Shiver me timbers!

18
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:15,685
Meow! I'm a witch! I can
turn you into a frog.

19
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:18,937
Neigh! I'm a clown!

20
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,099
That's funny!

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,454
And what are you,
Rebecca Rabbit?

22
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:25,670
I'm a carrot.

23
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,096
Fantastic! Come in.

24
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:32,117
There's a fairy princess and a
dinosaur waiting to meet you.

25
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:34,711
Hello, everyone!

26
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,157
Hello, Peppa!
Baa! Meow! Woof! Neigh!

27
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:40,251
Hello, Suzy,
I'm Princess Peppa.

28
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,387
You must bow
when you speak to me.

29
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,650
Hello, your majesty.
Baaa!

30
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,637
I'm Nurse Suzy!
Open wide and say "ahhh".

31
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:51,662
"Ahhh"!

32
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:55,865
Neigh... I'm a clown.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,677
Do something funny!

34
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,875
Woof! Rebecca, why are you
dressed as a carrot?

35
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,519
I like carrots.

36
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,521
Grrrrrrr!
Dine saw!

37
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,170
A scary dinosaur!

38
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,817
Peppa is admiring herself
in the mirror.

39
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,606
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

40
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,041
who is the fairest
of them all?

41
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:22,551
You are, Peppa.

42
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:25,522
Meow!
Hello, Peppa.

43
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,883
Hello, I'm a
little fairy princess.

44
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:29,867
I'm a witch. Meow!

45
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,440
And I've got a magic wand!

46
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,745
I've got a magic wand, too!

47
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,995
I can turn you into a frog.

48
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,574
And I'll turn you into a frog.

49
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,841
Dine saw
Grrrrrrrrr!

50
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,251
Waaaaaaaaaaaa!!!

51
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,164
Oh, dear, George is scared
of his own reflection.

52
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:54,390
Silly George, look, it's
you in the mirror.

53
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,070
Grrrrr!

54
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,390
Children,

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,756
it's time to decide who has

56
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,126
the best fancy dress costume.

57
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:03,996
We need a judge.

58
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,498
Me! Me!
Me!

59
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,841
As it's Peppa's party,

60
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,893
maybe she should be the judge.

61
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:11,965
I'm the judge!
I'm the judge!

62
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,684
Daddy,
what is a "judge"?

63
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,416
The "judge" decides who
has the best costume.

64
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:18,884
Oh, goody!

65
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,476
Peppa is going to choose
who has the best costume.

66
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,864
Suzy, can I see your
costume, please?

67
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,608
Baaa! I'm Nurse Suzy.
I make people better.

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,185
Very good, Nurse Suzy.
Now, Danny!

69
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,096
Woof! I'm a pirate!
Shiver me timbers!

70
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,144
Now, Candy.

71
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:43,012
Meow. I'm a witch.
I can turn you into a frog!

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,835
Well, I'm a fairy princess
and I can turn you into a frog!

73
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,508
Children!
Children!

74
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:51,890
Sorry, Mummy.

75
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,109
Who's next?

76
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:54,613
I'm a clown!

77
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,851
That's funny!
And Rebecca?

78
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,093
I'm a carrot.

79
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:04,730
Lovely.

80
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,292
And my little brother, George,
is a scary dinosaur.

81
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:11,603
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

82
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,818
Everyone's costume is very good.

83
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:16,439
Hurray!
Baa! Meow! Woof! Neigh!

84
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,732
Now you say who the winner is.

85
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:22,849
Oh, yes! Uh hum!
And the winner is...

86
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:24,465
Me!

87
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:29,198
Peppa you can't pick yourself!
You're the judge!

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,240
Oh! Can't I?

89
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,926
You have to pick another winner.

90
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,456
Okay, the carrot wins.

91
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:36,988
Hurray!

92
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:37,924
Thank you.

93
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,311
Peppa loves fancy dress parties!

94
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,239
Everyone loves fancy dress parties!
