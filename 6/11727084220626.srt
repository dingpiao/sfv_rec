1
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:20,377
My Cousin Chloe!

2
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,130
Peppa and George are
playing in the garden.

3
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,038
To me, George!

4
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,630
You threw the ball too hard, George!

5
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,201
So the rules say,
I win!

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,679
Now it's my turn.
I win again!

7
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:40,342
Peppa, George. Today your big cousin,

8
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,166
Chloe is coming to visit!

9
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,213
Yippee! Cousin Chloe!

10
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:48,623
George, Chloe is a big girl,
like me.

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,292
So, don't be sad if she finds
you too Little to play with.

12
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:56,270
I'm sure Chloe
will play with both of you.

13
00:00:57,254 --> 00:00:58,437
Chloe is here!

14
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,526
Aunty Pig has brought Chloe to
spend the day at Peppa's house.

15
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:04,966
Chloe is Peppa and George's cousin.

16
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,206
Chloe is a bit older than
Peppa and George.

17
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,947
Hello, Chloe!

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,192
Hello, Peppa! Hello, George!

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,023
See you later!

20
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:15,451
Do you want to play a game?

21
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:18,018
Yes! Let's play
"Catch!"

22
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,641
Peppa loves playing "Catch".

23
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:21,510
Do you still play "Catch"?

24
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,346
That's a game for Little children.

25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,659
We only play "Catch"
because George likes it.

26
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,891
Okay. Let's play it for George.

27
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:34,634
Do you play with the proper rules
or the baby rules?

28
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:35,938
Proper rules!

29
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,918
I'll start.
Peppa! You're "it".

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,576
Catch me if you can!

31
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:44,762
Peppa is "it". She has to
chase Chloe and George.

32
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,896
Can't catch me!

33
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:48,221
George!

34
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:51,918
I'm going to easily
catch you! You're so Little!

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,240
That's not fair!!
You're helping George!

36
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,143
That's because he's Little.

37
00:01:58,716 --> 00:01:59,796
Do you want me to help you?

38
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:03,703
No! I don't need help.
I'm a big girl like you.

39
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,093
Come on, then, Peppa!
Try and catch us!

40
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,808
Can't catch us!

41
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:12,325
Can't catch us!

42
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,328
This is a silly game.

43
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:15,747
Can we play something else?

44
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,496
Okay, I know a really good
game for big children.

45
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:21,976
It's called "Sly Fox"!

46
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:23,590
"Sly Fox"!!

47
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:27,901
I want to play "Sly Fox"!!
What is it?

48
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,668
One person is the "Sly Fox"

49
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,901
and the others creep
up on them.

50
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,223
Me! Me! I want to
be the "Sly Fox"!

51
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:37,859
Peppa is the "Sly Fox".

52
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,968
While her back is turned,
the others creep up on her.

53
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,256
But if Peppa turns and
sees someone move,

54
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,163
they have to go back to the start!

55
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:48,890
George, I saw you move!

56
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,022
Back to the start!

57
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,030
Got you! I win!

58
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,415
You moved before
I was ready!

59
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,993
The rules say I can
move when I like.

60
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,164
Don't they, George?

61
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,722
Now it's Chloe's turn
to be the "Sly Fox".

62
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:09,528
Peppa and George must
stay very still.

63
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:12,508
Whoaao!

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,541
Peppa! I saw you move!
Back to the start!

65
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,675
It's not fair!
You looked too long!

66
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:21,693
The rules say, I can look
as long as I want.

67
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,388
Back to the start.

68
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:27,390
George is the winner!

69
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,530
Can we play a different game?

70
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:31,308
Yes.

71
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,404
But as long as it's
a grown-up game.

72
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:34,497
I know!

73
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:37,030
Let's play my favorite game!

74
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:38,431
It's very grown-up!

75
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,504
George, do you know

76
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,595
what Peppa's
favorite game is?

77
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:45,779
Peppa's favorite game is

78
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:47,389
jumping up and down in muddy puddles!

79
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,977
George, if you jump in puddles,

80
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:51,785
you must wear your boots!

81
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,831
I've brought some boots
for you too, Chloe!

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,489
I'm too grown-up to jump
in muddy puddles.

83
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,239
Oh. So am I.

84
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,373
George loves jumping
in muddy puddles.

85
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,555
Secretly, Peppa would love
to jump in the puddle.

86
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,191
But she wants to look grown-up.

87
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,937
I hear there's some puddle
jumping going on!

88
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:17,269
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig love
jumping in muddy puddles!

89
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,054
It does look fun.

90
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:21,985
Yes, it does.

91
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,257
Maybe there's a rule that says,

92
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,633
big girls can jump in
muddy puddles.

93
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:30,367
Yes! That's a good rule!

94
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:33,253
Race you!

95
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,559
Race you!

96
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:38,196
Peppa and Chloe love jumping up
and down in muddy puddles!

97
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,583
Everyone loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles,

98
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:44,070
even grown-up girls!
