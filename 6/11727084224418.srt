1
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:19,825
School Play!

2
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,828
Peppa's playgroup are
going to put on a play.

3
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:25,539
The Little Red Riding Hood.

4
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,006
Hurray.

5
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,508
All the children have
parts in the play.

6
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,294
They have to practice at home.

7
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:34,798
Peppa is going to be the
Little Red Riding Hood.

8
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,467
Mummy Pig has
made her costume.

9
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,463
Daddy Pig is helping
Peppa practice.

10
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:42,244
Okay, Peppa, what do you say?

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,553
I'm Little Red Riding Hood.

12
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,551
Very good. Then what?

13
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:47,515
Um.

14
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,990
I'm going to visit my grandma!"

15
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,055
I'm going to visit my grandma!

16
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:53,714
Bravo, Peppa.

17
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:57,081
Danny Dog is going to play
the Big Bad Wolf.

18
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,271
Woof Woof!

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,615
Granddad Dog and Mummy Dog
are helping him practice.

20
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,521
I'm the Big Bad Wolf.

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,035
Try not to laugh, Danny.

22
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:09,835
You should be a bit scarier.
Try it like this, Danny.

23
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:16,625
I'm the Big Bad Wolf!
I'm going to eat you all up!

24
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,027
GRRRRRRR!

25
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:21,029
You see?

26
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:23,317
Yes! That was really scary!

27
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,244
Pedro Pony is going to play the Hunter.

28
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,755
He will rescue Peppa
from the Big Bad Wolf.

29
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:34,552
Um. I'm the Hunter...
and...

30
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:37,010
Pedro is a bit shy.

31
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:38,572
Neigh, you say,

32
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:41,621
"I'm going to chase you away,
you Big Bad Wolf!"

33
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,932
Um. Go away, naughty wolf.

34
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:48,037
Very good, Pedro.

35
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,107
Rebecca Rabbit is going
to be the Grandma.

36
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,466
What do I say, Mummy?

37
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,883
Lets' see.
At the start of the play,

38
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:57,398
you get locked in a
cupboard by the Big Bad Wolf.

39
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,798
Then, right at the end of the play,

40
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:01,751
you are rescued by the Hunter.

41
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:04,886
And you say, "Thank you."

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,573
Thank you.

43
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,023
Very good, Rebecca.

44
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,545
Everyone has come
to see the school play!

45
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:21,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to our play,

46
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:24,397
"The Little Red Riding Hood".

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,913
First, let us meet the actors!

48
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,183
Please, please!
For the sake of the actors,

49
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,430
no photography, please!

50
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,494
And now our play begins!

51
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:54,718
Grandma is at home.
But who is this visitor?

52
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:58,165
Woof woof! I'm the Big Bad Wolf.

53
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,900
Well done, Danny!

54
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,034
Um.

55
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:05,804
Oh, dear. Danny has forgotten
what he says next.

56
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,641
Grandma, you must
go in the cupboard.

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,903
Woof!
Go in the cupboard!

58
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:15,153
The Big Bad Wolf is
pretending to be Grandma!

59
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,627
Ooooh!

60
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:22,695
I am Little Red Riding Hood.
I'm going to visit my grandma.

61
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,116
Bravo, Peppa!

62
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:28,371
Daddy! You must not take photos!

63
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,369
Oops! Sorry, Peppa!
Carry on.

64
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,850
I'm going to visit my grandma.

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,349
Oh. You don't look like my grandma.

66
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,179
What big eyes you have.

67
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:44,984
What big teeth you have.

68
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,377
Grrr!

69
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:51,179
You are not Grandma!
You are the Big Bad Wolf!

70
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,618
Ooo...

71
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,980
Help! Oh, help!

72
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,679
But look who is here!

73
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,574
Just in time! Pedro the Hunter!

74
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,645
Help! Oh, help!

75
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,798
Just in time! Pedro the Hunter!

76
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,128
Pedro is a bit shy.

77
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:13,003
Pedro, would you like me
to come on with you?

78
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,102
Yes, please.

79
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,826
You are a very naughty wolf.

80
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:21,958
I've saved you, Grandma.

81
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:23,178
Hurray.

82
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:25,982
Thank you.

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,449
Bravo!

84
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,284
Bravo! Bravo!

85
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:33,180
Bravo!

86
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:35,658
Pedro, you were very good.

87
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:40,522
You were almost
as good as me.
