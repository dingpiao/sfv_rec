Ballet Lesson!

2
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:24,765
Peppa is going to her
first ballet lesson.

3
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:27,793
This is Madame Gazelle,
the ballet teacher.

4
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:30,583
Ah, ho! You must be young Peppa!

5
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:34,337
I am Madame Gazelle!

6
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:37,980
Hello, Madame!

7
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:41,858
So sweet!

8
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:47,580
Welcome to your
first lesson of the ballet!

9
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:49,929
I'll pick you up later!

10
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:50,557
Bye bye!

11
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,860
Enjoy yourself!

12
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,208
Here are Peppa's friends,

13
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:58,388
Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep, Danny Dog,

14
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:00,057
Rebecca Rabbit, and Pedro Pony.

15
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:05,636
Children, today we have
a new pupil, Peppa Pig!

16
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:08,510
Now Peppa, run and join your friends!

17
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,490
Hello, everyone!

18
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,201
Hello, Peppa!

19
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,776
Children! We begin
with demi-plier!

20
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:36,589
Demi-Plier. Now a
Little jump, petit jete.

21
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:45,423
With grace and beauty.
Petit jete!

22
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:49,806
Grace and beauty!

23
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,064
Petit jete!

24
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,745
Grace and beauty!

25
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,054
The ballet lesson
is a lot of fun!

26
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:10,427
Raise you arms!

27
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,094
Lmagine that you are
beautiful swans!

28
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:29,619
And what noise do you
think a swan might make?

29
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:39,180
Ah, ho.
Grace and beauty!

30
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:42,453
Peppa loves dancing!
Everyone loves dancing!

31
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:53,876
Mummy! Mummy!
We all danced as swans!

32
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:56,115
Peppa did very well!

33
00:02:56,607 --> 00:03:00,088
I had to dance beautifully
and gracefully!

34
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,390
That's lovely!

35
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:04,123
Can I show you how I did it?

36
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,745
Let's get home first.

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,426
Then you can show Daddy Pig,
and George, and me.

38
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,306
Bye bye!

39
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,091
Peppa and Mummy Pig
are home!

40
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,080
Daddy! George!

41
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,989
I'm going to show you
how to do ballet!

42
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,450
Is it difficult?

43
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,170
It was easy for me.

44
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,721
But you, George, and Mummy
will find it very hard.

45
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,689
First, we need music.

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,168
Good. Now, George, Daddy and Mummy,

47
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,362
you must copy what I do.

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,201
Madame Gazelle used funny words.

49
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,553
But really, it's just bending
your knees and jumping.

50
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:52,984
Ah, the petit jete!

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,994
Daddy! You know the funny words!

52
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,423
Mummy Pig and I used
to be quite good at ballet!

53
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:04,904
Do be careful, Daddy Pig.

54
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,867
Our favorite was
the pas de deux!

55
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,101
Hoop-la!

56
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,709
Ooofff! That wasn't quite
how I remembered it.

57
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,954
Silly Daddy Pig!

58
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:29,388
Maybe we should
leave the ballet to Peppa!

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,501
Yes, I am the best at it!

60
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:39,751
I am a beautiful swan!
