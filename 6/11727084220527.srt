1
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,444
The New Car!

2
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,486
Today, Peppa and her family

3
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,180
are going for a drive
in their red car.

4
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:33,409
Shall we have the roof down?

5
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:34,404
Yes, please!

6
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,229
Peppa and George love their car.

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,405
Is everybody ready?

8
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:43,479
Ready!

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,972
Then let's go!

10
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:53,751
I love our car!

11
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:58,082
And our car loves us, too!
Don't you?

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,100
Oh, dear, the car does not
sound very well.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,435
Hmm!

14
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,020
What's wrong, Daddy?

15
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,543
Hmmm! Er... I don't know.

16
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:19,129
Let's take it to
Granddad Dog's Garage.

17
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:20,384
He can fix it.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,154
That's a good idea, Mummy Pig.

19
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:27,246
Woof!

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,379
Granddad Dog runs the garage;

21
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,688
he is very good at mending cars.

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,958
Woof! Oh, dear, Daddy Pig!

23
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,783
Your car does not sound very well.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,863
Can you fix it, please,
Granddad Dog?

25
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:46,153
Yes...
...but it will take all day.

26
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,845
Ohhh...

27
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:51,140
We wanted to go for a drive in our car.

28
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,718
Woof! Don't worry.

29
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,252
You can borrow this new car
while I fix yours.

30
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,748
Hurray!

31
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,600
Thank you, Granddad Dog.

32
00:01:58,668 --> 00:01:59,817
Would you like the roof down?

33
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:00,914
Yes, please!

34
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:04,353
I'll just press this red button.

35
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:07,597
What a clever car!

36
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,435
Wow.

37
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,340
Woof! When you come back,

38
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:12,778
I will have fixed your car.

39
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,635
Thank you, Grandad Dog.
Goodbye.

40
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,322
Goodbye!

41
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,339
Bye bye!

42
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:19,116
Goodbye! Woof!

43
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,660
Peppa and her family
like the new blue car.

44
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,146
There are so many buttons
in this new car.

45
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,359
What does the green button do, Daddy?

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,385
Let's see.

47
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,915
Magic windows!

48
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,964
Daddy! Make the magic windows go down.

49
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,926
What does the blue button do?

50
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:48,127
I don't know. Let's see.

51
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,444
Arrgh!

52
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,923
I love this new car. Can we keep it?

53
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,165
No, we can't keep it, Peppa.

54
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,092
We've only borrowed it for today.

55
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,647
Ohh.

56
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,273
Oh, no, I think it's going to rain.

57
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,212
Yes, I'll just put the roof up.

58
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:16,343
Now, which is the button
to close the roof?

59
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:25,068
Oops! Silly me. Aha!
This must be the button.

60
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,188
Arrgh!

61
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,907
The new car has squirted
Daddy Pig with water.

62
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:32,497
Silly Daddy, that's not the roof!

63
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:37,181
This button! Oops!
Not that one! This button!

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,833
Arrgh! Help!

65
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,521
Daddy Pig has forgotten
which button closes the roof.

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,085
I don't think this car likes me!

67
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:47,525
Let's try the red button.

68
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,179
Hurray!

69
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,208
But now it's stopped raining.

70
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,077
Can we open the roof again?

71
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:01,045
Er, yes. Which button was it?

72
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:05,790
The red one! Hurray!

73
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:10,859
Granddad Dog has fixed the car.

74
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,345
Your car is fixed.

75
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:16,821
Hurray!

76
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,596
Thank you, Granddad Dog,
and keep the change.

77
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:23,105
Thank you, Daddy Pig.
Woof! Woof! Goodbye!

78
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,381
Goodbye!

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,351
Goodbye!

80
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:26,563
Bye bye!

81
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,653
Ahhh! It's good to get
our old car back again!

82
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:36,676
I liked the new car
but I like our old car better.

83
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:40,578
And I think our old car
likes us, too. Don't you?
