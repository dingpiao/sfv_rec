00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,328
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

53
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,466
This is Mummy Pig.

54
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,328
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

55
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,466
This is Mummy Pig.

56
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,903
And this is Daddy Pig.

57
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,068
Peppa pig.

58
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,353
Mr. Dinosaur is Lost.

59
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,291
George's favourite toy
is Mr. Dinosaur.

60
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,724
DineDine SawSaw.

61
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,095
George loves Mr. Dinosaur.

62
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,298
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr..

63
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,368
Sometimes, George likes

64
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,030
to scare Peppa with
Mr. Dinosaur.

65
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,003
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

66
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,735
Eeek. Too scary.

67
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,246
At suppertime,

68
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,542
Mr. Dinosaur sits next to George.

69
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,244
I beg your pardon.

70
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,623
Was that you George,
or was it Mr. Dinosaur?

71
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,125
DineDine SawSaw.

72
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:06,693
At bath time,

73
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,024
George shares his bath
with Mr. Dinosaur.

74
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,532
Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.

75
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,130
Goodnight, Peppa.

76
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,397
Goodnight, Mummy.

77
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,403
Goodnight, George.

78
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,478
And goodnight, Mr. Dinosaur.

79
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,642
Grrrrrrrrr.

80
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,780
When George goes to bed,

81
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,484
Mr. Dinosaur is tucked up with him.

82
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,049
George's favourite game is

83
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,422
throwing Mr. Dinosaur
up in the air...

84
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,584
Wheeeeeee.

85
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,854
...and catching him
when he falls back down.

86
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,789
Wheeeeeeeee.

87
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,169
Peppa and Daddy Pig are
playing draughts.

88
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,301
I win, Daddy.

89
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,111
Oh, welldone, Peppa.

90
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,079
Whhhhaaaaaaaaaaa.

91
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,674
George?

92
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,680
Whaaaaaaaaa.

93
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,516
George, what's the matter?

94
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,817
Dinosaur...

95
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,389
George, have you
lost Mr. Dinosaur?

96
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,597
George has lost
Mr. Dinosaur.

97
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,758
Don't worry George.

98
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,458
We'll find Mr. Dinosaur.

99
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,898
It's a job for a detective.

100
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,608
Daddy, what is a detective?

101
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,473
A detective is
a very important person

102
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,045
who is good at finding things.

103
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,617
Me. Me. I'm good at
finding things.

104
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,483
Alright. Peppa is the detective.

105
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,355
George. I am the detective.

106
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,654
I will help you find Mr. Dinosaur.

107
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,989
Maybe the detective should ask

108
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,224
George some simple questions.

109
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,234
George? Where's Mr. Dinosaur?

110
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,001
Whaaaaaaaaaa.

111
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
George did not know
where Mr. Dinosaur is.

112
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,005
The detective could try and guess

113
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,510
where Mr. Dinosaur might be.

114
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,440
I know. I know where he is.

115
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,887
George always has Mr. Dinosaur
with him in the bath.

116
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,015
So Mr. Dinosaur is in the bath.

117
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,656
Mr. Dinosaur is not in the bath.

118
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,754
Oh. I know.

119
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,956
I know where Mr. Dinosaur is.

120
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,469
George always has Mr.
Dinosaur in his bed at night.

121
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,338
So that's where he is.

122
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,210
Mr. Dinosaur is not in George's bed.

123
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,037
Oh.

124
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,907
Maybe we should try the garden.

125
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,907
Yes, the garden.

126
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,280
I was going to see that.

127
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,288
Where is Mr. Dinosaur?

128
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,057
Mr. Dinosaur is
very hard to find.

129
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,556
Oh. Mr. Dinosaur
isn't anywhere.

130
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,695
George? You do love to throw
Mr. Dinosaur in the air...

131
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,430
I wonder if this time

132
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,805
you threw Mr. Dinosaur
just a bit too high.

133
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,440
There he is. There he is.

134
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,014
I saw him first.

135
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,251
Well done, Peppa.

136
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,720
You really are a
very good detective.

137
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,821
DineDine SawSaw.

138
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,455
Grrrrrrrrrr.

139
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,465
George is so happy to have
Mr. Dinosaur back again.

140
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,728
Wheeeeeeeeee.

141
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,962
Maybe it isn't a good idea

142
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,474
to play with dinosaurs near trees.

143
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,478
Dinosaur.
