00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,473
Lunch!

2
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:25,416
Peppa and George have come to

3
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:27,073
Granny and Grandpa Pig's
house for lunch.

4
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:29,928
Granny Pig!

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,565
Ganggy lg!

6
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,086
Hello, my little ones!

7
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:38,263
Would you like to pick some vegetables
from the garden for lunch?

8
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,238
Yes, please!

9
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:45,745
Grandpa Pig!

10
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,105
Baba lg!

11
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,834
Hello, Peppa, George.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,831
This is Grandpa Pig's vegetable garden.

13
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,519
He has grown all these
vegetables himself!

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,253
What's this?

15
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,688
Dinesaw!

16
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,574
A dinosaur!

17
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,975
Let's choose some vegetables for lunch.

18
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:13,324
Peppa, do you like tomatoes?

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,417
Yes, Grandpa Pig!

20
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:18,346
George, do you like tomatoes?

21
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:19,613
No.

22
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:23,949
George does not like tomatoes.

23
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:31,500
Oh, dear.
Do you both like lettuce?

24
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,003
Yes, Grandpa Pig!

25
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,192
No.

26
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:37,649
George does not like lettuce.

27
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:42,271
Oh, dear! I must have something
that George likes.

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,312
Do you like cucumber?

29
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,152
Yuck!

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,787
George does not like cucumbers,

31
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,144
and he does not like lettuce,

32
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,022
and he does not like tomatoes.

33
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,197
Well, George, what vegetable
do you like?

34
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:57,727
Chocolate cake!

35
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,297
Silly George! Chocolate cake
isn't a vegetable!

36
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,255
Maybe George will like
the vegetables

37
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,169
when they're made into
a lovely salad.

38
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,475
Ooh! Lovely fresh tomatoes,
lettuce and cucumber!

39
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,163
First, we have to wash them!

40
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,536
Peppa and George help Granny Pig
wash the vegetables.

41
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,530
Maybe that's enough washing.

42
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,045
Granny Pig has made
the tomatoes, lettuce

43
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:38,668
and cucumber into a salad.

44
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,208
Grandpa Pig, can you call
everyone to lunch?

45
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:43,464
Lunch!!!

46
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,723
Granny Pig has made
pizza for lunch.

47
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,414
And here's some salad

48
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,365
made with Grandpa's tomatoes,
lettuce and cucumber!

49
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:56,721
Chuck in, everyone!

50
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:07,233
George has eaten his pizza.

51
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,871
But George does not like the tomatoes

52
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,537
or the lettuce or the cucumber.

53
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,677
Oh, dear, George.
Don't you like the salad?

54
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:16,761
No.

55
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,692
George, just try a little bit
of this lovely tomato.

56
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:22,469
Yuck!

57
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,580
George. This is cucumber.

58
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,192
Grandpa Pig grew it in his garden!

59
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,743
Errrgh!!

60
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,535
Try a piece of lettuce,
George. It's yummy!

61
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:43,168
Now, now, George.
Look what I'm doing.

62
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,216
Now, it's a dinosaur!

63
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:49,761
Dinesaw!

64
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,111
George loves dinosaurs!

65
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,843
George is eating the tomatoes,
lettuce and cucumber!

66
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,484
Well done, George!

67
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,383
Would you like
some more, George?

68
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:07,045
Full.

69
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,206
George, are you too full

70
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:13,115
to eat any more tomatoes,
lettuce or cucumber?

71
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,337
George is too full to eat any more.

72
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:20,107
George, are you too full
to eat anything more?

73
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,798
George is too full
to eat anything more.

74
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:28,380
Oh, well, then you won't want
any of this CHOCOLATE CAKE!

75
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:30,906
Chocolate cake!

76
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,191
My word!

77
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:39,890
George seems to have
got his appetite back!
