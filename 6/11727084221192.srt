1
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,041
Treasure Hunt!

2
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:25,950
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are

3
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,263
making a treasure hunt for
Peppa and Geroge.

4
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:30,266
Granny Pig is drawing the treasure map.

5
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,514
Grandpa Pig is burying the treasure

6
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,257
in a secret place in the garden.

7
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,838
Grandpa Pig! Have you finished?!

8
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,664
Peppa and George will be here soon!

9
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,105
No need to panic, Granny Pig!

10
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:49,875
Peppa and her family are here!

11
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:53,151
Quick, Grandpa Pig! They're here!

12
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,125
Almost done!

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,011
Grandpa Pig just finished in time!

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,396
Granny Pig! We're here!

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,994
Ganggy lg!

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,870
Hello, my Little ones!

17
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,388
Grandpa Pig!

18
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,756
Baba lg!

19
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:13,621
Ahoy there, me hearties!

20
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:17,962
Peppa, George, we've
made you a treasure hunt!

21
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:22,158
Somewhere in the garden
is buried treasure!

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,464
Wow! Treasure! Where is it?

23
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,409
You have to look for it.

24
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,667
Here's a treasure map for Peppa.

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,427
And George can wear my pirate hat.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,896
Ahoy there, Captain George!

27
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:45,016
The map is a bit difficult.
Daddy, can you help?

28
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,685
Of course, Peppa.
I'm very good with maps.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,456
Er. It is a bit difficult.

30
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:52,993
Daddy Pig,

31
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:55,974
you're holding the map upside down!

32
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,245
Yes, I thought as much.

33
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:04,758
It's easy! The red cross shows
where the treasure is!

34
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:07,655
But where in the garden are
those two apple trees?

35
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,217
Hmmm... I don't know.

36
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:11,690
Would you like a clue?

37
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,179
Yes, please!

38
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:16,346
The first clue is in a bottle.

39
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,013
But where is the bottle?

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,687
I can see it!

41
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,172
Peppa has found the first clue.

42
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,458
A message in a bottle.

43
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,727
Look, everyone!
Here's the bottle!

44
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:34,041
Well done, Peppa!

45
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,789
Let's see what the message says.

46
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,122
Oh it's a message from a pirate!

47
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:43,689
Mummy? Can you read
the pirate's message?

48
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,335
Hmm... This pirate has
very bad handwriting.

49
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,939
The pirate's handwriting is excellent.

50
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,781
No, I can't make it out at all.

51
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:55,255
The pirate has clearly written,

52
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,972
"Follow the arrows!"

53
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,351
Follow the arrows?

54
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:02,569
George has found the second clue!

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,472
Sticks in the shape of an arrow!

56
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:06,624
Look! They point this way!

57
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,109
Peppa and George are
following the arrows.

58
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:15,659
Look, George! A key!

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,742
Peppa has found the next clue. A key!

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,227
Well done, Peppa!

61
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,230
Now you just have to find

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,881
the treasure chest that it unlocks.

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,727
But there aren't any more clues.

64
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:31,363
Maybe you should take
another look at the map...

65
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:35,003
Look, Peppa, the map
has two apple trees on it.

66
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,012
Here's an apple tree!

67
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,182
And here's an apple tree!

68
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:44,417
So the treasure must be here!

69
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:46,435
Let's take a look!

70
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:55,232
Oh, dear. There doesn't
seem to be anything here...

71
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,254
Hang on! There is something here!

72
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,850
Wow! Treasure!

73
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:03,711
Hurray!

74
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,642
Well done! Well done!

75
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,384
I've got the key to open it!

76
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,357
Wow! I can't believe it!

77
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,959
Gold coins! They must be worth a fortune!

78
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,857
It's better than that!
They are not gold coins,

79
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,613
they are chocolate coins!

80
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:26,763
And there's a chocolate
coin for everybody.

81
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,809
Hurray!

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,857
Peppa and George love chocolate coins.

83
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:33,810
Everyone loves chocolate coins.

84
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,371
Granny, Grandpa,

85
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,936
this is the best treasure hunt ever!
